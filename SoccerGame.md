# Text Version: Winning Eleven

Welcome to Object Oriented Programming world! Let's design a simple soccer game using OOP design thinking.

![](images/soccer-game.jpg)

You would have either played soccer or at least heard of this most popular sports game in the world. But
it's not that easy to organize a formal match. You need to prepare a lot of stuff, below is a minimum survival
task list:

+ Find a stadium where there is a formal soccer field with fixed width and length
+ Find two soccer teams, each team shall have one head coach, one or more assistant coach, 11 players and at least 3 substitutes
+ Coach should have attributes like name, age, how many champions won in his carrier
+ Each player should have his name, number, age, height(in cm), position(Forward, Midfielder, Defender, Goalie) in the field
+ Color of jerseys of the home team and the visiting team must be different and easy to recognize
+ Find one major referee, two linesman
+ Prepare at least one Size 5 soccer ball
+ Audiences: there would be many crazy soccer fans shouting there
+ Rules(only some of them, so that you will not be scared):
  + There will be two halves, each 45 minutes
  + If any of these criteria were matched then the game will be paused:
    + Soccer ball is out of the field
    + Referee whistles when one player fouls against another
  + If any team scores, game will stop for a while until then the other team kick off in the middle

Based on these minimum required classes and the simplified real-world example, please design a series of classes
to simulate a soccer game in text mode only.

```java
java Game
// When user input start, Start or START, prompt available teams for him to select
:user-input start
:system-out Here we go! Please select home team first:
:system-out Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester United, Chelsea, Juventus, AC Milan
:user-input Real Madrid or R or 1
:system-out You have selected Real Madrid as the home team.
:system-out Please select the visiting team then:
:system-out Barcelona, Manchester United, Chelsea, Juventus, AC Milan
:user-input Barcelona
:system-out You have selected Barcelona as visiting team
:system-out Please select the stadium for the match: San Siro, Nou Camp, Bernabeu, Old Trafford
:user-input Bernabeu or B or 3
:system-out Good job! All settle down. Game started.
```

Your code might be like this(just for your reference, you can do it on your own):
```java
public class Game {
    private Stadium stadium;
    private Team homeTeam;
    private Team visitingTeam;
    private SoccerBall ball;
    private Referee majorReferee;
    private Referee[] linesmen;
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Game game = new Game();
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {
            if (scanner.nextLine().equalsIgnoreCase("Start")) {
                System.out.println("Here we go! Please select home team first:\n" +
                    "Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester United, Chelsea, Juventus, AC Milan");
            }
            if (scanner.nextLine().equalsIgnoreCase("Real Madrid")) {
                Team homeTeam = new Team("Madrid");
                homeTeam.headCoach = ...;
                homeTeam.assistantCoaches = [...];
                homeTeam.players = [...];
                homeTeam.substitutes = [...];
                
                game.homeTeam = homeTeam;
            }
            // More stuff here and there...
        }
    }
    
}
```

You need to submit at least `Game.java`, `Stadium.java`, `SoccerBall.java`, `Team.java`, `Player.java`, `Coach.java` and `Referee.java`. You may
add other classes freely according to your own design, for example, the invisible `Rule` and visible `Audience`.

For `SoccerBall.java`, besides attributes of color and size, please maintain its location in the field, so that we can know whether it's a goal,
or still in the field, or out of field already.

### Challenge
Objects without behavior are simply dead. Can you try to simulate the match in text mode and respond to certain kinds of
events if they violate the rules declared?

```java
// ...simulate events of players: change their position randomly, choose their behaviors randomly, such as pass, shoot, foul and etc
:system-out Bale passes the ball to Benzema
:system-out Benzema shoots and...scores! Goal!
:system-out Now the score is Real Madrid 1 : 0 Barcelona
:system-out Messi fouls against Modric! Referee whistled!
:system-out Game paused for 30 seconds // Your program can sleep 30MS to simulate 30 seconds
......
:system-out The match ended with the score of Real Madrid 2:1 over Barcelona!
```

### Champion
Text output is not straightforward and cool, can you design a simple user interface to visualize the soccer game?

You can use squares of different colors to simulate players, a circle to simulate soccer ball. A black square for referee,
two yellow square at each line for the linesman.

You can draw all the lines to form a soccer field, and draw players of two teams, then make them move and move.ðŸ˜…

A very simple implementation looks like this:
